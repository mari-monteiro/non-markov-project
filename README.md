# non-markov-project
This project aims to study the Markovian/Non-Markovian dynamics of a single qubit interacting with a CCA for a homogeneous, disordered and correlated configuration of field modes (local energies). Basically,
we observe a change from non-Markovian to Markovian decay in the presence of disorder by tuning the correlation parameter (\alpha).

Once the pre print of the article is avalible, I'll upload it in this repository. It may be more efficienty then me trying to explain it on this file :). 

Disclaimer: I wrote one of the codes "Markovi5.f90" (yes, Fortran and yes, it works quite good), I tried to keep it clean. The other code was written by one of the professors involved and it is quite disturbing (in a good way) and efficient, tbh. Maybe one day I'll rewrite, maybe I won't. I don't know.

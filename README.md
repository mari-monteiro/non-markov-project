# non-markov-project
This project aims to study the Markovian/Non-Markovian dynamics of a single qubit interacting with a CCA for a homogeneous, disordered and correlated configuration of field modes (local energies). Basically,
we observe a change from non-Markovian to Markovian decay in the presence of disorder by tuning the correlation parameter (\alpha).

Once the pre print of the article is avalible, I'll upload it in this repository. It may be more efficient then me trying to explain it on this file :). 

Some codes here are quite disturbing, feel free to ask me anything. Maybe one day I'll rewrite it, maybe I won't. I don't know.
